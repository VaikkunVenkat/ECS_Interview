## Docs on how to run app

This repo represents [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as part of the ECS interview.

The `master` brach contains my main work - and the `feature/with_dataMuse` branch is my attempt at trying to integrate the `dataMuse` api as one of the stretch points.

## Available Scripts

To start the app, run: 

### `npm start`

to commence the local development server.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
